# Heart Attack Prediction

## Introduction
Heart is one of the main organs of the human body. The blood in the human body is pumped through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. This circulatory system is vital as it transports blood, oxygen and nutrients to various organs of the body while carrying metabolic waste such as Carbon Dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is the size of a fist when closed and is located between the lungs, tiled slighly towards the left. If the heart does not function properly, it will lead to serious health conditions and any unforeseen circumstances such as death.
