# Heart Attack Prediction


## Introduction
Heart is one of the main organs of the human body. The blood in the human body is pumped through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. This circulatory system is vital as it transports blood, oxygen and nutrients to various organs of the body while carrying metabolic waste such as Carbon Dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a fist when closed and is located between the lungs, tiled slighly towards the left. If the heart does not function properly, it will lead to serious health conditions and any unforeseen circumstances such as death.  

**Myocardial Infarction (MI)** which is also know as _**Heart Attack**_ is a medical emergency and is one of the dealiest health problems and has caused many lives every year. It is caused when the flow of blood is blocked to the heart muscle. When the flow of blood stops, the tissues loses oxygen and dies. The most common symptoms of heart attack is Chest pain which travels from the shoulder to arm to neck to back pain. The other symptoms are nausea, shortness of breath, fainting, tiredness, cold sweat. The duration of a heart attack depends on the kind of attack. A mild heart attack which occurs when faced the symptoms can last anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes while a full heart attack caused by complete blockage lasts longer, anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes.

## Technology
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has made its way through the healthcare sector. The first instance when AI was used to accurately measure and scan the flow of blood is what the doctors require. AI has a knack of picking up abnormal growths better than doctors, this is primarily because of digesting and synthesizing large volumes of information. A UK based health tech firm developed an AI based device known as _**EchoGo Pro**_ to make predictions on Coronary Heart Disease (CAD) with the help of ultrasound analysis. This device generates instant results, delivering a heart disease prognosis to the hospital sites through a secure cloud based system, which has an in-built partnership with the UK National Health service based on the past records. This technology would suit clinics where the doctors can recommend the necessary treaments to improve the blood flow of the patients and the doctors at hospitals can focus more on the place where they are required the most, i.e., spending time with patients than manually checking the outcomes of every patient. 

In another study, professionals at University of Oxford have developed a _**Fingerprint**_ (or biomarker) device with the help of machine learning. This technology helps in detecting any biological red flags in the blood vessels which pumps blood to the heart. This device helps to find the 'bad' attributes in and around the arteries of a human body. This has a high potential to detect the disease at an early stage, which in turns helps to take the necessary measures prior to the strike of a heart attack, ultimately helps in saving lives.

**Internet of Things (IoT)** along with a wearable monitoring device is a growing technology which is anticipated to contribute a considerable range of healthcare applications. These applications are gather the essential data, such as real time changes in health parameters which in turn updates the rigorous medical parameter's within a standard time interval. So, the IoT devices instantly produce large amount of data for healthcare. IoT devices such as Apple watch and Fitbit are wearable gadgets with an in-built sensor connect to eHealth mobile application to gather data about their health condition such as the heart rate, blood pressure, glucose level, etc. Electrocardiogram (ECG) network is a base for the entire system, which is responsible for gathering data from the body surface and transmitting these data into an IoT cloud through a wireless channel. This data is then stored and analyzed in an effective and efficient manner and has the potential to predict a storke or heart attack or any heart related disease possibly days in advance. This helps the individual to take the necessary steps or measures to either prevent or reduce the risk of facing the problem.
