# Heart Attack Prediction


## Introduction
Heart is one of the main organs of the human body. The blood in the human body is pumped through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. This circulatory system is vital as it transports blood, oxygen and nutrients to various organs of the body while carrying metabolic waste such as Carbon Dioxide to the lungs. In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a fist when closed and is located between the lungs, tiled slighly towards the left. If the heart does not function properly, it will lead to serious health conditions and any unforeseen circumstances such as death.  

**Myocardial Infarction (MI)** which is also know as _**Heart Attack**_ is a medical emergency and is one of the dealiest health problems and has caused many lives every year. It is caused when the flow of blood is blocked to the heart muscle. When the flow of blood stops, the tissues loses oxygen and dies. The most common symptoms of heart attack is Chest pain which travels from the shoulder to arm to neck to back pain. The other symptoms are nausea, shortness of breath, fainting, tiredness, cold sweat. The duration of a heart attack depends on the kind of attack. A mild heart attack which occurs when faced the symptoms can last anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes while a full heart attack caused by complete blockage lasts longer, anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes.

## Technology
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has made its way through the healthcare sector. The first instance when AI was used to accurately measure and scan the flow of blood what the doctors order. AI has a knack of picking up abnormal growths better than doctors, this is primarily because of digesting and synthesizing large volumes of information.

This technology would suit clinics where the doctors can recommend the necessary treaments to improve the blood flow of the patients and the doctors at hospitals can focus more on the place where they are required the most, i.e., spending time with patients than manually checking the outcomes of every patient. 

**Internet of Things (IOT)**
